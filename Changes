0.6  Mon Feb 11 2007, 15:33 -0200
        - use warnings
        - make all prereqs explicit
        - don't hide the use of Term::ANSIColor
        - require warnings::compat on pre-5.6 perls
        - no real code change: idleness is an evil thing

0.5  Fri Jun  1 2007, 09:07 -0300
        - now accepts an import tag :color (or :colour) and
          produce colored warnings (with Term::ANSIColor)

0.3  Wed May 30 2007, 16:36 -0300
        - 0.2 got tests right, but broke Makefile.PL
        - that was out of order for too long

0.2  Tue Aug 22 2006, 14:27 -0300
