NAME
    Acme::Note - Make a mental note for programming style

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Note;
      # and then your honorable Perl script

    Or at command line

      perl -MAcme::Note script.pl
      perl -MAcme::Note=:colour script.pl

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes you just have to remember that odd little thing.

      Tell you what. Let's just issue a mandatory warning at the startup of
      every Perl script that says:
      "???"
